This directory contains 3 html files:
- **index1.html**

Initial sketch: The data in this file contains the code before I ask for any feedback regarding my visualizations.

- **index2.html**

The data in this file contains the code with my changes based on _feedback 1_ I received.

- **index3.html**

The data in this file contain the code with my changes based on _feedback 2_ I received.

There is also **index_final.html** which includes the code with changes based on _feedback 3_ I received; however, I decided
to place this file in the main directory since it was the final version of my code.
